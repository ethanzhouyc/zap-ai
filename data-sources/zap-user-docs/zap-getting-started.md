# Getting Started with ZAP

These sections describe different methods to create Zigbee and Matter applications. Note that Simplicity Studio provides a way to create your Zigbee and Matter applications from end to end where all tools come pre-installed along with Simplicity Studio (including ZAP). You may also decide to explore other ways of creating your applications, as described here.


## Zigbee Development
Zigbee application developers can build their applications using [Simplicity Studio](https://docs.silabs.com/zigbee/latest/zigbee-getting-started-overview/), which already includes ZAP and other tools that help you build your application from end to end.


## Matter Development
Matter Application developers can build their applications using the following methods:
- [Simplicity Studio](https://docs.silabs.com/matter/2.1.1/matter-overview/): This includes ZAP and other tools which are needed to build the Matter application end to end.
- [Github (Silicon Labs)](https://siliconlabs.github.io/matter/latest/)
- [Github (CSA)](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip)


Note: To update ZAP outside the Simplicity Studio release cycle, see [update ZAP in Simplicity Studio](../zap-users-guide/update-zap.md) and [ZAP Installation Guide](zap-installation.md)
