# Notifications

The following section defines how notifications are given to ZAP users in the UI.

## Package Notifications
Package notifications are the warnings or error messages associated for any specific package loaded into ZAP.
For example, in the images below, clicking the warning icon under the status column will lead you to a dialog showing all notifications for that package.

## Session Notifications
Session notifications are the warnings or error messages which are associated with a user session. These warnings/errors can be seen by clicking on the `Notifications` button in the toolbar on top of the ZAP UI.

For example, the image below shows the session notifications page after an isc file was loaded into ZAP.
